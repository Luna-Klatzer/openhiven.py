Not all changes will be noted here, but main ones! Added \u00b6 Message-Broker for handling incoming events and distribute them to the listeners. Event-Buffers, which store the events and will one by one execute the events/ call its listeners. This can be changed by setting queue_events in the client to False, which means all tasks are immediately sent to the event-loop and executed in the next cycle if possible. New event_parsers file with a new execution schema, where calling the function will simply add the event with its data, args and kwargs to the buffer. Added HivenEventHandler as a class and interface for listeners and functions related to that. Implementation of SingleDispatchEventListener , which will listen for an event once and execute an assigned coroutine when the event is received. This can be done dynamically using HivenEventHandler.add_single_listener() Implementation of MultiDispatchEventListener , which will listen for an event until the bot is stopped. Will call a coroutine every time the event is received. Creating one can be done dynamically using HivenEventHandler.add_multi_listener() wait_for function in HivenEventHandler , which will dynamically wait for an event. This will under the hood create a simple SingleDispatchEventListener . It will return the data passed to the function as well. dispatch_event function in HivenEventHandler , which will dynamically add a new event to the buffer with the args and kwargs passed. call_listeners to call all listeners for an event based on the passed args and kwargs. This will call them directly and not utilise the message-broker unlike dispatch_event HTTPRateLimitError for receiving http rate-limits (429) and parameter retry_on_rate_limit to raw_request() Parameter remove_listeners to HivenClient.close() , which will, if set to True, remove all listeners created using @client.event(), add_multi_listener() and add_single_listener() Changed \u00b6 Rewrite of the base structure Proper WebSocket structure, with init handling that will delay all other incoming events until the Bot is ready. This means when the Bot enters ready state all cached events are sent to the event-buffer. Base Types for referencing general types in the library Cache implementation using cache.py, which will hold and store values and provide functions for generating data and update the cache correctly. This will remove implementations in the data classes itself. Dot-Env Handling, which will now load the openhivenpy.env file on default and update all variables based on the given input. This will avoid None values when an .env file only updates a few values Removed \u00b6 Old structure (everything not mentioned in changed or added is likely gone) v0.1.3.2 - 2021-04-09 \u00b6 Added \u00b6 Updated validation traceback #69 Updated presence to be a string and removed the deprecated and unneeded class Changed \u00b6 Small code enhancements before v0.2 rewrite Removed \u00b6 Unneeded exception log inside the exception strings and replaced it with from e to have a cleaner traceback v0.1.3.1 - 2021-04-09 \u00b6 Added \u00b6 Error-messages for ValidationError in from_dict() inside type classes Changed \u00b6 Updated MANIFEST.in #68 Fixed with removal of name parameter in asyncio.create_task() which is unsupported in 3.7 Removed \u00b6 Old licensing of FrostbyteSpace and updated the URLs to the latest changes v0.1.3 - 2021-02-16 \u00b6 Added \u00b6 HivenObject as Base for Type Classes more TypeHinting using the module typing ObjectValidation as in #46 using an integration of a @classmethod for object creation as explained in #37.

Current API access-point: Host: api.hiven.io Version: v1 URL: https://api.hiven.io/v1/ Authentication Header \u00b6 The Hiven API uses a classic header authorization where your auth-token is passed as a parameter in the header of the request.

OpenHiven.py is an easy tool for creating bots and utilising API Functionality of Hiven. Its goal is to be fast but also provide good tools and functionality that can be used to write Hiven Bots easier. Therefore, OpenHiven.py is not a simple API-Wrapper but adds nice features to make running a bot easier such as: Data Caching for easier object fetching Event listening using parallel execution and a MessageBroker to distribute processes for larger Bots WebSocket event and message handling for easier usage Usage of in-code event listeners to not be dependent on entire functions Info The OpenHiven.py module is entirely written in async and can therefore only be used in an async event loop and environment. For more info about asyncio look into the Asyncio documentation Environment \u00b6 OpenHiven.py is a Python module and can currently on be run in environments with Python >= 3.7. This is due to the used module aiohttp which requires Functionality only available in Python 3.7 or higher! Python 2 is entirely not supported, and currently, there is no plan to make the module available for Python 2, since many features are dependent on Python 3 and the modern async module of Python 3 as well as aiohttp! Installation \u00b6 OpenHiven.py can be easily installed using pip : PyPi Regular Installation python3 -m pip install -U openhivenpy PyPi Specific Version python3 -m pip install -U openhivenpy == version Github Build Warning Can be unstable due to development status! Only use if you need the most recent development version! python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/Luna-Klatzer/OpenHiven.py/archive/main.zip Installing OpenHiven.py will automatically also include its dependencies, which currently are: aiohttp - Async http client/server framework (asyncio) fastjsonschema - Fastest Python implementation of JSON schema yarl - Yet another URL library python-dotenv - Read key-value pairs from a .env file and set them as environment variable Basic Concept \u00b6 The system of OpenHiven.py is very closely related to the discord.py (Discord Python Wrapper) module and was structured to be similar to it. Therefore, the basic concept is based on an event listener system where events are mapped to user-specified functions and methods. These are user-declared and therefore only what you specify will be executed and utilised, so the handling is up to you. The Hiven Swarm \u00b6 The module uses a aiohttp HTTP Websocket Connection to interact with the Hiven Swarm and react to events that the server sent over it. In case of an event, Hiven will send the corresponding data to you in the form of JSON-wrapped messages which gets automatically handled in OpenHiven.py. That means the library deals with events, keep-alive, close-frames and handling of the connection, and you only need to configure how to react. So, in this case, the Websocket will then pass the data to the EventHandler where the Hiven Swarm message will get processed, and an event would be triggered if the user declared it. Event listening with the EventHandler \u00b6 The system used here is a classic event listening system where a client listens and waits over the connection for events and triggers specified code when the Websocket received such event. In Web-Languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP etc. this is common practise and applied for websites, servers and clients. In Python, this is less common, so here it is not already integrated into the language, so OpenHiven.py uses aiohttp to provide the option for a Connection to Hiven and its own Event Handler , which handles how the Client should react to such events. Now onto actual examples of how that works: To add an event listener, you must declare an async function with the correct name inside the HivenClient. This can be done either by inheriting the Client and then adding the method or using decorators . Async Functions that are tagged with the @client.event() decorator will automatically be registered in the EventHandler and then called whenever an Event is triggered. Note All events that can you can use are listed on the page for the EventHandler . Example with the event on_message_create : import openhivenpy as hiven client = hiven . UserClient ( token = \"\" ) @client . event () async def on_message_create ( msg ): print ( f \" { msg . author . name } send a message: { msg . content } \" ) ... Using OpenHiven.py \u00b6 Using a UserClient \u00b6 Source Code \u00b7 openhivenpy.UserClient A UserClient object is an object that wraps the default HivenClient , which serves as a bridge between Hiven, and the Program you are using. The HivenClient contains all data and connection-vital information, but is not supposed to be used directly since some methods are not available due to the raw state. These are special methods related to the bot-type that decides based on what type you are using, resulting in various functionality. These two bot-types are here UserClient and BotClient . For the usage of a HivenClient, you are required to pass your token, which it will use to authorise on Hiven and request data. If no token was passed, it will automatically raise an openhivenpy.exceptions.exception.InvalidToken Exception! Usage Examples Regular Note that using a decorator will also automatically add the function as a method to the Event Handler instance itself so it can call it directly from the Event Handler and it doesn't need to reference the origin! import openhivenpy as hiven client = hiven . UserClient ( \"Insert token\" ) @client . event () async def on_ready (): print ( \"Bot is ready\" ) client . run () Inherited Decorators are useful for beginners and for a quick setup, but it is recommended to use a class which inherits the HivenClient, making the Event listener directly find the methods when needed without needing the methods to be registered. This can save time as well as remove unneeded logic import openhivenpy as hiven class Bot ( hiven . UserClient ): def __init__ ( self , token ): self . _token = token # Calling __init__ of the parent class and inheriting all methods and functionality super () . __init__ ( token ) # Not directly needed but protects the token from ever being changed! @property def token ( self ): return self . _token # Methods can be defined directly in the class async def on_ready ( self ): print ( \"Bot is ready!\" ) if __name__ == '__main__' : client = Bot ( token = \"Insert token\" ) client . run () Using a BotClient \u00b6 Source Code \u00b7 openhivenpy.BotClient A Bot Client like the UserClient is a wrapper for the main HivenClient class. It serves as a Class using bot functionality on Hiven. Therefore, it's usage is very similar to the UserClient, but it can specifically utilise Methods and functions related to text-commands and will likely receive in future versions more updates specifically adding that functionality. Warning The current release v0.1.3.2 the BotClient lacks major optimisation and functionality. Therefore, bugs are likely to occur! If you encounter such bugs, please report them! Hiven-Types \u00b6 Source Code \u00b7 openhivenpy.types You might have already noticed in prior examples that instead of raw data OpenHiven.py sends entire instances of Classes with the event data as parameters. This is because of the type-system OpenHiven.py uses where objects are created and initialised parallel to the corresponding Hiven ones, making it easier for usage due to the easy attribute and data access of a Python class. These instances can then be used through methods to interact with the Hiven API directly, instead of you having to write your own requests for fetching the data and having to update the objects accordingly yourself. For each possible request OpenHiven.py already ships a pre-made method to the class which automatically changes data and returns configured objects if that specific methods returns data.

Based on the user input it will log only these errors of its own category and higher than it. That means if WARNING was specified, ERROR and CRITICAL will also be logged. The available levels for logging are: Levels Description CRITICAL Logs only very critical errors ERROR Logs only errors WARNING Logs only warnings and errors in the program INFO Logs only vital information about the program DEBUG Logs every output related to the running program See logging levels for complete docs Simple Example of logging \u00b6 To utilise logging you are only required to import the module and specify the level. That can be done in less than two levels. Example import logging logging . basicConfig ( level = logging . INFO ) This code snippet will activate all logging in the range of the program. That means imported modules would also log their information if they have logging used in their module.
